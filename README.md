# Inventory Management System

## Overview

- This project is a basic inventory management system developed in Java, which involves reading and writing to a database utilizing a CSV file.
- The system provides functionality for adding, removing, selling, and restocking items, along with various sorting and viewing operations.
- Originally created as a prototype for the backend of an online merchandise storefront, the program serves as a foundation for managing items with attributes such as quantity and price.

## Purpose

- Developed to support the backend of a mockup online merchandise storefront.
- Allows users to view and modify a database containing items with various attributes.

## Features

- Options to add, remove, sell, and restock items.
- Various sorting and viewing operations for efficient data management.

## How it Works

- Items are stored in a CSV (comma-separated values) file, a common format for datasets.
- The program loads this file on startup, reading each item and placing it into an ArrayList.
- Each item's data is associated with it and stored as an object in the ArrayList.
- Users can modify item quantities using commands, and changes are reflected in the CSV file on execution.

## Usage

- The user can interact with the program to manage the inventory effectively.
- Add or remove items, restock, sell, and perform sorting and viewing operations.
